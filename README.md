*m    **************

-> make a good modular makefile + add the gnl libft and mlx42 librarie 
-> read documentation of mlx42 and make prototypes to see how things work
-> ask about the difference between mlx42 and mlx

> it's really important to have good "reperage" meaning know what left right top and down means in the context of your program's map  

-> start by making a 2d map and try to fix collisions and ray casting  
-> raise walls with distinct color   s for each side to make things easy at the start
-> let textures be the very last thing you add

# things to note

-> watch pikuma videos
-> reviser les relations de : tan / cos / sin
-> les limites de tan a gauche et a droite de pi/2(use desmos.com)
